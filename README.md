This is a Sample Project build around using RightSignature's Document and Template API's

1. Modify the Example.cs file to your needs.
2. RightSignature allows users to authenticate with the server through OAuth or Secure Token.
    - Use the App.config file in the project to set the consumer key and secret and/or secure token,
      based on the authentication method used.
3. For any questions about the API calls please follow the documentation at:
